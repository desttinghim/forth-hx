# Haxe Concat

This is a concatenative language, written in Haxe. It's purpose is to be used
as a scripting language in games. Specifically, for the GameBoy styled fantasy
console I plan to make. A concatenative language has been chosen as the scripting
language because of it's power, simplicity, and terseness. When you have such a
small space allowed for the code to be shown, it *needs* to be short.
